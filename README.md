A technical test for building a home page in Wordpress

This theme is custom built by me from scratch

Its all my own code (I have not used AI generated code)

I have used the latest version of wordpress

I have used the free version of Advanced Custom Fields

From what I understand, lazy loading is now built in as part of wordpress since version 5.5. However, to be sure I have installed the autoptimize plugin and switched on lazy loading

I have installed the all in one migration plugin. However the final file size is 150mb and too big to email

Please use this repository as a reference for all the core theme files

I have also ftp'd the site up to a subdomain. Details are below:
